        <p> My name is Rachel Poulsen. I live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and work full time at the best credit union in
            town as the Vice President of Member Solutions. The best part of my job is being able to help members find
            solutions to their financial problems. I married the boy next door 30 years ago. We have two wonderful sons,
            Brett and Derek and two fur babies, Lola and Oakley.</p>
